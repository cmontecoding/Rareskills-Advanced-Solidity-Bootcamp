This is all of my coursework for the Rareskills Advanced Solidity Bootcamp

[RareSkills](https://www.rareskills.io/) is a 4-6 month engineering fellowship focused on producing senior blockchain engineers through intensive hands-on coding, security exercises, and weekly code reviews.

Coursework includes but is not limited to:
- Re-implement the ERC1155 token protocol in Yul language (assembly)
- Advanced design patterns such as proxies, clone factories, and metamorphic contracts
- Security & Gas optimization exercises and CTFs, Damn Vulnerable Defi, Ethernaut, Solidity Gas puzzles, EVM puzzles, Solidity Riddles
- Unit, fuzzing, invariant, mutation testing

Note for other Rareskills fellows: For the sake of time, some sections are incomplete and were exchanged with in-person learning/instruction. For example, there is no work here for Gas Optimizations or EIP712. Also, I took notes in notion instead of READMEs so the code might be less documented. I have a lot of notes so if you have questions feel free to message me in the slack!
