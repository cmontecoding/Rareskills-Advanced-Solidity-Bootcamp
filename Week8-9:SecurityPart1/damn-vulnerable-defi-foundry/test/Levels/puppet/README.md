# Challenge #8 - Puppet
There's a huge lending pool borrowing Damn Valuable Tokens (DVTs), where you first need to deposit twice the borrow amount in ETH as collateral. The pool currently has 100000 DVTs in liquidity.

There's a DVT market opened in an [Uniswap v1 exchange](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v1/overview), currently with 10 ETH and 10 DVT in liquidity.

Starting with 25 ETH and 1000 DVTs in balance, you must steal all tokens from the lending pool.
