# Challenge #9 - Puppet V2
The developers of the [last lending pool](https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry/tree/master/test/Levels/puppet) are saying that they've learned the lesson. And just released a new version!

Now they're using a [Uniswap v2 exchange](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/introduction) as a price oracle, along with the recommended utility libraries. That should be enough.

You start with 20 ETH and 10000 DVT tokens in balance. The new lending pool has a million DVT tokens in balance. You know what to do ;)
