Question 3: Why does the openzeppelin upgradeable tool insert something like uint256[50] private __gap; inside the contracts? To see it, create an upgradeable smart contract that has a parent contract and look in the parent.

This is for when you have larger smart contract architectures and you upgrade and add new storage slots. In a situation with just 1 contract you can append storage. But in a situation with multiple contracts you might not be able to append storage properly like if it is on a parent contract: this would shift the storage slots of the child contracts. The gap allows parent contracts to add storage slots without shifting the storage slots of the child contracts. When you add a storage slot you remove a value from the gap. This is a way to future proof the contracts.
