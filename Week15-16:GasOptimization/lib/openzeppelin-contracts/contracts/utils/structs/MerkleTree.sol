/**
 * @dev Library for managing https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_Tree[Merkle Tree] data structures.
 *
 * Each tree is a complete binary tree with the ability to sequentially insert leaves, changing them from a zero to a
 * non-zero value and updating its root. This structure allows inserting commitments (or other entries) that are not
 * stored, but can be proven to be part of the tree at a later time. See {MerkleProof}.
 *
 * A tree is defined by the following parameters:
 *
 * * Depth: The number of levels in the tree, it also defines the maximum number of leaves as 2**depth.
 * * Zero value: The value that represents an empty leaf. Used to avoid regular zero values to be part of the tree.
 * * Hashing function: A cryptographic hash function used to produce internal nodes.
 *
 * _Available since v5.1._

     * using a secondary structure to store a list of historical roots (e.g. a mapping, {BitMaps} or {Checkpoints}).
